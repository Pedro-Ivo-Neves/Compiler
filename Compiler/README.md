## Structure

It has two main folders, which are:
1. [SRC](./src)
    - [Executar](./src/Executar.java)
    <br> 
    To execute File where the program should run, that is, it is the project's **_main_** ;

    - [analysis](./src/analysis/) 
    <br> 
    Folder where everything that is analyzes will be dealt with. Which will be: **_Lexicon_** , **_Syntax_** , **_Semantics_** ;

    - [constants](./src/constants/)

    - [classificacao](./docs/classificacao/)
    <br>
    Here you have all the **_words_** and **_symbols_** that exist by default in **_Java_** in their respective text classifications ;
